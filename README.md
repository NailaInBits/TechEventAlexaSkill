This is a [working] repo for an Alexa skill that allows you to search through meetup.com and find tech related events in your area.

# TechEvents: an Alexa Skill
I'm very active in the NYC tech scene and meetup.com is an excellent source to find events. Therefore I decided to create TechEvents. It's an Alexa skill that will allow users to search for tech related events in NYC on meetup.com.

I used the meetup.com API and built the Alexa skill in node.js

"The Future Labs, a network of innovation spaces and programs supporting early stage startups in New York City, and Amazon will host the Future of a Conversation, an Alexa Hackathon. The Alexa and Echo hackathon will challenge participants to create voice-based user interfaces for Alexa, the software supporting Amazonâ€™s Echo hardware. This is an opportunity to build a skill for Alexa that you would not only like to use, but believe could be a front-runner for this technology."
